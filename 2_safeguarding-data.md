## Safeguarding Data 
***Develop privacy and security compliance policies, standards, and controls.***

**Policies** are high-level statements about how data should be handled, similar to a vision statement. Standards outline the rules that govern putting policies into action, and controls provide specific instructions about how to implement a standard.

In order to facilitate secure and compliant data sharing:
* Data requesters must understand the privacy and security compliance standards of the data they are requesting 
* Data owners must ensure that they clearly define the privacy and security compliance standards that govern the data they own

The points below highlight how to define and understand privacy and security compliance.

**Establish a privacy policy.**

A privacy policy is an externally-facing document for the people you might collect data from. It explains how your agency uses personal information that may be collected when the public interacts with the agency. The privacy policy should include the types of information gathered, how the information is used, to whom the information is disclosed, and how the information is safeguarded. 

Here are some of the questions to ask when you document a privacy policy: 
* Why do we collect personal information?
* What information do we collect? (Review the data dictionary.)
* When and how do we disclose/share information?
* How do we protect personal information, including the administrative, technical, and physical strategies?
* How do we protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of confidential information that is created, received, maintained, or transmitted?

**Document critical data elements.**

Confidential Information (CI) is any non-public information pertaining to the agency’s business. Personally identifiable information (PII) is any data that can be used to identify an individual. Examples of PII include a user’s name, address, phone number, and social security number. 

Data owners should also document subsets of PII, such as:
* Protected Health Information (PHI) — information about an individual’s health
* Payment Card Industry (PCI) data — credit card information
* Education records — data maintained by a school about students that includes information like test scores, special education records, courses taken, and attendance
