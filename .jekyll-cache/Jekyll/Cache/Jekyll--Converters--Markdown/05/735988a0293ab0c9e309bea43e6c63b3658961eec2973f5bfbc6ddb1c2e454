<p>Identifying who plays each data-related role allows organizations to establish who has the responsibility of fielding external inquiries, designing sharing procedures, and executing requests. It is the first step in setting up a strong data governance model and maintaining institutional knowledge of the data sharing process.</p>

<p>Although the roles below are described separately, sometimes the same person may exercise more than one role. For example, a single contractor may act as both the steward and custodian for the agency’s data. In small agencies, the data officer may also fulfill the data owner, custodian, and steward roles. The important takeaway is that the team needs to know who’s the go-to for each set of responsibilities in the data system.</p>

<h3 id="agency-data-officer">Agency data officer</h3>

<p>Agency data officers are responsible for serving as the main contact person for inquiries, requests, or concerns regarding access to the data of an agency. The agency data officer, in consultation with the Chief Data Officer and the executive agency head, establishes procedures to ensure that the agency complies with requests for data in an appropriate and prompt manner.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="data-owner">Data owner</h3>

<p>The data owner is accountable for the quality and security of the data and holds the decision-making authority about data within their domain. The data owner varies by agency. In some agencies, a data officer is the data owner, and in others, it may be the program lead.</p>

<h3 id="data-steward">Data steward</h3>

<p>The data steward is responsible for the governance of data and ensures the fitness of content and metadata. Stewards exercise established processes, policies, guidance, compliance, and rules in this effort. They are usually the subject matter experts and data analysts that work with the data on a daily basis.</p>

<h3 id="data-custodian">Data custodian</h3>

<p>A data custodian is responsible for the technology used to store and transport the data. The role can be filled by either a person or team, and data custodians are usually database administrators, data analysts, or software engineers.</p>

<h3 id="legal-counsel">Legal counsel</h3>

<p>Legal counsel is a person or team that can evaluate the legality of data-sharing agreements and uses of data.</p>

<h3 id="privacy-and-compliance-officer">Privacy and compliance officer</h3>

<p>This person or team develops and implements policies and procedures to protect individual rights and comply with federal and state law. The privacy and compliance officer also investigates any data breaches.</p>

<h2 id="create-and-publish-a-data-dictionary">Create and publish a data dictionary.</h2>

<p>A publicly available data dictionary helps requesters understand what data your agency owns. It can also help them craft requests that reference specific tables and fields, making the request easier to fulfill.</p>

<p>The data dictionary should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Describe all of the datasets your agency is responsible for</li>
  <li>Contain information on how each of the datasets was collected</li>
  <li>Define the individual fields in each of the datasets</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="update-connecticuts-high-value-data-inventory">Update Connecticut’s High Value Data Inventory.</h2>
<p><a href="https://data.ct.gov/Government/2019-CT-Data-Catalog-Non-GIS-/f6rf-n3ke/">Connecticut’s High Value Data Inventory (Non GIS)</a> and <a href="https://data.ct.gov/Government/2019-CT-Data-Catalog-GIS-/kr39-sdfm/">Connecticut’s High Value Data Inventory (GIS)</a> are data catalogs that highlight general information about high-value datasets. By keeping your agency’s datasets up to date in the catalog, you help other agencies and the public understand what data your agency owns and who to contact for more information. The High Value Data Inventory should be updated annually at a minimum in December.</p>

<p>To update the inventory, email both <a href="mailto:scott.gaul@ct.gov">scott.gaul@ct.gov</a> and <a href="mailto:pauline.zaldonis@ct.gov">pauline.zaldonis@ct.gov</a> with the subject line “CT High Value Data Inventory Change Request.”</p>

<h2 id="review-data-for-implicit-biases">Review data for implicit biases.</h2>

<p>The data that government agencies and others collect most likely contain implicit biases. These biases can be introduced due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Whose data is collected</strong> — Does a dataset contain a representative sample of people in multiple ethnicities?</li>
  <li><strong>Whose data isn’t collected</strong> — Does the data leave out a specific demographic group that might not frequent the service where the data is collected?</li>
  <li><strong>How the data is collected</strong> — For example, is the data collected via interview in one area and via a form in another area?</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider possible sources of bias in your agency’s data carefully. If you don’t identify possible bias and work to eliminate it, the decisions made based on these data may have unintended, serious societal implications.</p>

<h3 id="heres-an-example-of-how-implicit-bias-can-have-unintended-consequences">Here’s an example of how implicit bias can have unintended consequences:</h3>

<p>Researchers discovered that a major health provider’s algorithm favored white patients over black patients when deciding who would benefit from extra medical care. The researchers attributed the algorithm’s bias to the data that was used to create it.</p>

<p>In the US, white patients incur more medical costs than black patients due to long-standing disparities in wealth and access to healthcare. Because of this difference in access to care, the algorithm perpetuated the disparity by determining that white patients would benefit more from extra medical care than sicker black patients.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="work-to-eliminate-possible-sources-of-bias">Work to eliminate possible sources of bias.</h2>

<p>As organizations become more data-driven, data experts are discovering more instances in which unaccounted biases in data perpetuate racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination.</p>

<p>While awareness of possible bias in data is the first step, the goal is — of course — to eliminate bias. This may mean systemic changes to data collection practices. While you’re working to revisit and update these practices, be open about the limitations of the agency’s data to reduce the likelihood that it will be used in ways that have unintended consequences. The recommended reading below provides guidance on identifying and eliminating sources of implicit bias.</p>

<h2 id="develop-a-data-request-process">Develop a data request process.</h2>

<p>A clearly documented data request process can facilitate successful requests. This section covers some of the supporting documents to develop as part of a comprehensive data request process.</p>

<p>Remember that the data request process must abide by the regulations and laws that apply to each dataset. For more detailed information, refer to Establish a privacy policy and Legal Issues in Interagency Data Sharing Report.</p>

<h3 id="request-form">Request form</h3>
<p>Ensure that the data requester answers the questions below in order to evaluate the benefits and mitigate the risks of sharing data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the purpose of the request?</li>
  <li>How does the requester plan to use the data?</li>
  <li>Who will have access to the data?</li>
  <li>What are the specific data they are requesting, and what are the specific parameters?</li>
  <li>How long is the requester seeking to keep the data? When and how will the data be destroyed?</li>
</ul>
